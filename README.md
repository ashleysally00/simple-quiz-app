# Simple Quiz App 

This is a basic quiz application written in Python. It allows users to test their knowledge on various topics through a series of questions.
Alternatively, you can download the file, change the topic, questions, and answers to design your own quiz!

## Features

- Randomly selects questions from a predefined list
- Provides immediate feedback on user answers
- Offers explanations for each question
- Allows users to continue playing or exit after each question

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `quiz_app.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `quiz_app.py`.
5. Run the script using the command:
   ```
   python3 quiz_app.py
   ```
6. Answer the questions as they appear.
7. Choose whether to continue or exit after each question.

## Customization

You can easily add more questions to the quiz by editing the `questions` list in the `quiz_app.py` file. Each question should be a dictionary with "question", "answer", and "explanation" keys.

## Note

I made this simple quiz app with input from AI while trying to creat a simple app to quiz myself in basic Python. I am still working on that one, but you can find it [here](https://github.com/ashleysally00/simple-quiz-app/blob/main/python-quiz-app.py).
